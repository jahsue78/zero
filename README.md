# Zero Connected Home

## Hardware List
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ (with power adapter)
- Micro SD card and a micro SD to SD adapter
- Ethernet cable

## Setup

### Install Raspbian

We want to flash the Raspbian OS on the mirco SD card. This version of *Zero* has been tested with Raspbian Stretch with Desktop (2018-06-27 release). The steps described below correpond to the headless installation mode (without screen) with ethernet connection to your home network.

1. Download Raspbian [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
2. Extract to a new folder, you will have a single `.img` image file.
3. Download and install Etcher [here](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). We use it to flash the image file on the micro SD card.
4. Launch Etcher, select the Raspbian image file, select the SD card and flash the OS on it.
5. Insert the micro SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect the power adapter and connect to the home network via ethernet.
6. Open a web browser and connect to your router (e.g., go to [fritz.box](fritz.box) for FRITZ!Box users).
